This is a recreation and extension of *Random Squares* by Bill Kolomyjec featured in the August 1977 issue of *Computer Graphics and Art* as found at [Triangulation](http://www.triangulation.jp/2013/09/computer-graphics-art.html).

You can edit the code to work with any resolution, density of grid, number of arrayed squares, and size of the smallest square. Play with it.
