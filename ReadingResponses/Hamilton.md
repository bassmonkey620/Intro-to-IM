During one of the few conversations between my grandmother and I before she passed, she told me she worked her entire life in 
the computer industry, mostly with IBM. Due to my privilege as a man, I never appreciated the significance of that statement. 
At fourteen, I knew about sexism and patriarchy, but I did not know about the “boys’ club” McMillan references. Over the last six years,
I have learned much, so I felt a little disappointed by McMillan’s article. While McMillan wrote an excellent highlight piece of Margaret
Hamilton’s work, the article features little nuance regarding why a woman in a male-dominated industry matters. Of course, there is also
the question of why does this woman have to be positioned according to her position in a power hierarchy instead of according to her work.
If McMillan’s goal was to focus upon Hamilton’s work, then some of the patriarchy humor seems inappropriate, or at least unnecessarily
irreverent. On the other hand, I’m careful to not exaggerate this criticism as something that makes the article not worth reading. 
What Hamilton accomplished deserves to be imbued into our collective memory, for both the impact her accomplishments had and the reminder
that role models come in more than one gender. If anyone is interested in reading more about women in the early computer industry,
I would recommend *Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet* by Claire L. Evans.
