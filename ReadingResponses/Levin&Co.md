Computer vision is incredible, but it might also be a technology which could be overused. After I read this article, I started to brainstorm for my final project, and computer vision was central to every idea. To avoid becoming pigeon-holed into using a technology instead of exploring an idea, I redid the session with the rule that no computer vision could be used. This experience was a productive reminder of maintaining focus on the problem or idea at hand. Of course, the technology warrants the temptation. The idea of being able to develop a program which can “read” gestures, posture, faces, and movement opens up a world of interactions as potentially as large or larger than the range of human expression. Of course, it’s simultaneously terrifying from a data mining and exploitation point of view, making the consideration of plausible futures through speculative design an important method for those who choose to push computer vision farther. As always, we must consider who and how people will benefit from what we design.
