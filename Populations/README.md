Don't forget the data file.

This project builds upon Cubes. It models the relative population size and density of the countries in the world. Data was obtained from http://worldpopulationreview.com/. The number of cubes corresponds to population size and the size of the cubes corresponds to the population density.

This project is not finished. It is currently in a purely static mode, but the intention was for it to dynamically grow, as in Cubes.
