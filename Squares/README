This is a recreation of _Ranom Squares_ by Bill Kolomyjec featured in the August 1977 issue of _Computer Graphics and Art_
as found at [Triangulation](http://www.triangulation.jp/2013/09/computer-graphics-art.html).

You can edit the code to work with any resolution, any density grid, any number of arrayed squares,
and any size of the smallest square. Play with it.
