This is a recreation of a piece from the August 1977 issues of Computer Graphics and Art as found at 
[Triangulation](http://www.triangulation.jp/2013/09/computer-graphics-art.html).
You can edit the code to work with any resolution, any density grid, any number of arrayed squares, and any size of the smallest square.
Feel free to play with it.
